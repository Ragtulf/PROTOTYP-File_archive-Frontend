# Prototyp Programming Task ðŸ’»ðŸ—„

This is my solution to the programming task - File archive. 
Allowed filetypes are pdf and jpeg. There is a posibility to add metadata. The files are listed in columns and the information is fetched from a database. It is possible to click on a filename and view the content in a new window. There is a possibility to delete an object with a click on the button.

## How I did it

I wrote this in React using Mongoose for backend and Cloudinary to store images. The website is styled using styled-components. I started on the backend and the model. Then I worked on the fetches from the frontend and got the logic to work. Lastly I worked on the styling.
